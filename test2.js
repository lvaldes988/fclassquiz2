//1. Name and describe the two main operations of a stack (to add and remove data)
pop and push 

//2.Name and describe the two main operations of a queue (to add and remove data).

//3.Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: 30, 45, 15, 10, 50, 40, 20, 27
                30
    27  20            50  45

    10  15             40

//4.Is this tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or 
leftRotation(10))

//5.Now add 29. Is the tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))
rightRotation(30)

//6.Consider the following tree:
------5
---2-----8
-1--3

Now add 0 to the tree. Which one is the first node to go out of balance?

node 2

//7.How do you fix this node? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))

rightRotation

//8.What are the four main steps of mergesort?
//1) Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves: 
//2) Call mergeSort for first half: Call the function mergeSort 
//3). Call mergeSort for second half: Call the function again mergeSort
//4) Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3: Call merge
